This is the top-level CIM storage for Species (like templates for objects,
and can have descendants), and Objects (instances, which are descendants of Species).  

All of these are stored as JSON files here for now, 
but this data storage should eventually get sharded and replicated
across a network-transparent interactive database, which will be crucial
for multiplayer.
